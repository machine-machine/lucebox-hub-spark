// Cross-feature compatibility gate.
//
// One place for admission rules that combine a requested feature with facts
// only known after model and placement resolution. Before this existed the
// same rules were spelled out at two or three layers, each seeing a different
// slice of the config, so no single site was authoritative.
//
// Syntax and value parsing stay at the parse site. Once raw arguments have
// been parsed, every launch-compatibility rule belongs here: cross-flag
// requirements, compiled-backend placement, layer-split topology, and
// architecture-specific feature support.
//
// This is policy; model_capabilities.h is the fact it reasons over. The two
// stay separate because they change for different reasons — the table changes
// when create_backend()'s dispatch changes, these rules change when a
// combination is judged inadmissible — and because the table is a leaf header
// that callers with no interest in BackendArgs can include cheaply. It is
// pulled in here rather than left to each caller because every rule below is
// phrased in its vocabulary; keep the include even though no declaration in
// this header names a capability type.
//
// Warnings are a separate return channel, not a separate layer.
// collect_feature_warnings() reports flags that are accepted but inert on the
// resolved architecture and placement — the request still runs, just without
// that feature, so it must not fail admission. Degradations that mutate config
// on the way through ("--draft-residency=request-scoped ignored", "--spark
// ignored") stay with the setting they rewrite; a pure function returning
// strings cannot express those.
